# Android-Implicit-Intent
 This code is an Android application written in Java that demonstrates how to launch an email activity using an explicit intent. The main purpose of the app is to send an email with a predefined email address, subject, and body. Below is an explanation of the code:  1. The package name is declared: `package com.example.explicit;`  2. Import statements are provided for required Android classes and libraries.  3. The `MainActivity` class is defined, which extends `AppCompatActivity`.  4. A `Button` object is declared as a class member: `Button button;`  5. In the `onCreate` method, the layout for the activity is set using `setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);`. The layout is defined in an XML file, which is typically named `activity_main.xml`.  6. The Java `button` object is linked to the XML button with the ID `btnActivityOne` using `findViewById`.  7. An implicit intent is created to send an email using the `Intent.ACTION_SEND` action.  8. The email data is specified in the intent using `setData`, `putExtra`, and `setType` methods. The email address (`"rush99@gmail.com"`), subject (`"This is our test subject"`), and body (`"This is our body"`) are predefined.  9. A chooser is created for the intent to allow the user to select their preferred email client from a list of applications that support email.  10. A click listener is set on the `button` using `setOnClickListener`.  11. When the `button` is clicked, the `onClick` method is executed, and the email activity is launched using `startActivity(chooser)`. The user will see a list of email applications to choose from, and after selecting one, they can send an email to the predefined address with the specified subject and body.  Please note that this code assumes that you have the necessary permissions and email client applications installed on the device. Additionally, you need to ensure that the `activity_main.xml` layout contains the appropriate button with the ID `btnActivityOne`.
